# b31dg-assignment1
This repository contains the required deliverables for my submission of B31DG Assignment 1:
  - assignment.ino is my arduino implementation of the waveform algorithm.
  - the "main" folder includes main.c, my vscode adaption of the same algorithm.
  - also in "main" is header.h, a header file that should be used for *both* main.c and assignment1.ino
